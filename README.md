# Löve2D Starter Kit

Quick start project for [Löve2D](https://love2d.org/) projects

## Important

Most of the code is based on examples from [Harvard CS50G](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50G+Games/home) and includes code taken directly from there, with or without alteration.

Original code can be found on the [GAMES50](https://github.com/games50) GitHub account.

The CS50G course code is built to run on love v[0.10.2](https://github.com/love2d/love/releases/tag/0.10.2) and won't run on newer versions without some alteration.
